title: Good news; Roblox now works on Linux!
---

As you may say in the title, yes, finally, thanks to Wine 6.11, Roblox now works on Linux! No need to use a virtual machine, although there are some bugs.

I might will eventually come back to Roblox again to make more Roblox games, who knows? Also, I was pretty excited that I can play Roblox again on my Arch Linux setup!
