Hi there! I'm just a student and I make things and share it in my website (or in my blog, perhaps) like games, artworks, programs, and more.

Also, I use Arch by the way. I used to have Ubuntu, but now I use Arch Linux. I've been using Linux since 2020 (because yes, stuck at home and quarantine, ended up using Arch Linux as my daily-driver).

I don't really accept donations, however if you want to, feel free to [donate me to support my works through PayPal!](https://paypal.me/linerly) Even a dollar already helps me. :D

P.S.: This blog is a bit new and it's not really organized (yet), however I will tidy it up soon.
